===============================

This application is being developed as a training exercise for the Udacity course "Developing Android Apps".

## Configuration

The app relies on OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the weather information.
You need to create an API key following the instructions [here](http://openweathermap.org/appid), then
create a new `app/default.properties` file (see sample file in [`app/sample.properties`](app/sample.properties)
and paste your API key there.
